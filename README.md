Get started:

- create your own repo (for example on www.github.com)
- change the origin to your own repo with `git remote set-url origin <remote_url>`
- copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure a database
- run `composer install` to install all dependencies
- run `php artisan test` (1 test should succeed and 3 should fail)

Good luck! 🍀🚀
