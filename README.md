Get started:

- create your own repo (for example on www.github.com)
- change the origin to your own repo with `git remote set-url origin <remote_url>`
- create a mysql database for the project
- change working directory to repo dir
- run `./setup.sh` (1 test should succeed and 3 should fail)

- open `app/H`


Good luck! 🍀🚀
